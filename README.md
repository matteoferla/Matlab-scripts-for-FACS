# Matlab-scripts-for-FACS
A collection of scripts and snippets I use for FACS with the BioRad S3e. It is meant for Oxford Biochem folk â€”no interpers! ;)

## dscatter
This is a mod of [dscatter](http://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/8430-flow-cytometry-data-reader-and-visualization?focused=6779476&tab=function) present on the exchange. It has two mods. First it has logx parameter and secondly it has the following change:

    minx = min(X(~isinf(X)),[],1);
    maxx = max(X(~isinf(X)),[],1);
    miny = min(Y(~isinf(Y)),[],1);
    maxy = max(Y(~isinf(Y)),[],1);

This stops it from throwing an error due to infinite values.

## fca_readfcs
This is a mod of [fca_readfcs](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/9608-fcs-data-reader) by the author himself to deal with 3.1.

Like all FCS files, there is little sense in the numbers. In the S3e case, the numerical values are integers that are x.01 of the units seen in ProSort (so are to be divided by 100).

	data=fca_readfcs(file_name)/100;

Therefore the numbers are 0:1E-2:1E4.

The gate is stored as column 21 and is converted into a double. I am unsure how the numbers are converted into string. (See gate_check.m for a script to check).


## example
This is just an example of a scatter pot and a histogram in a rather handy format... a protofunction if it weren't of for the fact that I keep changing bits.

The import is nice though.
Basically it relies on a file called `sheme.cvs` with the following fields:
* samplelist. This is a one-two letter code for the sample (e.g. A)
* name. The pretty name
* file. the filename
* colorR. R of RGB for lines
* colorG. G
* colorB. B
* style. The line style of the histogram.
